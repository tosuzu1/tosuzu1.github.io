## Introduction

Our final project for my class EE205 Data Structure, we were given a task to build a project to show what we have learned about C++ using objects. Our team being a group of gamer, decided to build a simple game, using ncurse. This was the first time we made any games and used objects as we only had prior knowledge in C. Another thing our group wanted to try was to collaborate our work on Github. We knew that Git was a industry standard on collaboration, so we wanted to dip our toes into git and github to build our experiance for our future careers.

## Building our game

For this project, we initially had a lot features we wanted to implement, such as a insanity meter, multiple mob with random attack and many more features that we thought we could cram into our game., but as the deadline was a lot sooner than expected, we learn that implement features would often break other feature with had previous implement. As a result we had to rebuild our feature set and list more reason goals. Another issue we encounter was understanding git, as a lot of time have merge conflicts that at the time we did not understand how to resolve, and ended up deleting the entire repositor just to reupload our latest version. Although we had many failure, we also gained experiance in building a project as a team.

## My role in the project

For this Project, I built the object for the enemy classes and assist my team with the equipment class. While working on this project, we learned about basic code collaboration by using discord to communicate with each other and github to share and control our code. This project was my first major step in learning about teamwork in a programming environment and also help me understand object-oriented programming.
