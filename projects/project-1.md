summary: My team developed a text based Role-Playing-Game to display what we learned about objects in C++.
---


For our final project for our class EE205 Data Structure, we were given a task build a project to show what we learned about C++ using objects.  We decided to build a simple game, using ncurse. This was the first time we made any games and used objects as we only had prior knowledge in C.

For this Project, I built the object for the enemy classes and assist my team with the equitment class. While working on this project, we learned about basic code collaboration by using discord to communicate with each other and github to share and control our code. This project was my first major step in learning about team work in a programming enviroment and also help me understand object-oriented programming.
