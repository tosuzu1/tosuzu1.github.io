summary: Building a simple single stage legv8 CPU in Verilog.
---

This project was my attempt at building a single stage legv8 CPU using Verilog. Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. In this project we were given a diagram of LegV8 CPU, a short program chip, and some small modules such as a mux that was prebuilt to build a CPU capable of decoding the instruction and performing operations similar to a CPU.
 
By completing this project helped me better understand how a CPU works, deep down inside its register and gates. It gave me a deep look into how programs are translated into opcodes and register data which all take different paths inside a CPU depending on the operation, one step at a time.
 
This project has helped me understand the hardware side of computer engineering, as learning how FPGA are built, using verilog is very different from how programming works, as the program describe hardware and thus doesn’t run the code line by line, rather describe and map how the FPGA will act.
