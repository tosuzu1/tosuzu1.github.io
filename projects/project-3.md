summary: Building a simple single stage legv8 CPU in Verilog.
---
This project was my attempt at building a single stage legv8 CPU using Verilog. Verilog is a hardware description language (HDL) used to model electronic systems. In this project we were tasked given a diagram of LegV8 CPU, a short program chip, and some small modules such as a mux that was prebuilt to build a CPU capable of decoding the instruction and performing operations simular to a CPU.
