The Army's project to expand its satellite network to support more bandwidth for the warfighter to provide more C4I for today's modern battlefield. The growing need for secure voice and video as well as data on the move helped grow the Regional Hub Node into its primary communication architecture.

In the US Army, I was assigned to the Regional Hub Nodes located in Fort Bragg, NC and Guam. While Stationed at the Regional Hub Node, I've participated in the installation, operation, and maintenance of satellite communications and internet protocol routing networks that supported over 60% of the U.S. Armyâ€™s telecommunications missions.

This was my biggest learning experience, learning to work in a team on massive networks that span over 1000s of IP, working on the latest in satellite communication  gear as well as gaining new skills such as learning how to configure Cisco routers, switches, and VOIP gear to support the modern warfighter.
