The Army's project to expand its satellite network to support more bandwidth for the warfighter to provide more C4I for today modern batterfield. The growing need for secure voice and video as well as data on the move help grow the Regional Hub Node into its primary communication architecture.

In the US Army, I was assigned to the Regional Hub Nodes located in Fort Bragg, NC and Guam. While Stationed at the Regional Hub Node, I've participated in the installation, operation, and maintenance of satellite communications and internet protocol routing networks that supported over 60% of the U.S. Armyâ€™s telecommunications missions.
