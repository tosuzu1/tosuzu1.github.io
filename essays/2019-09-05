Javascript is an interesting language which is a huge departure from what I'm used to working as a computer engineer. As a Computer Engineer, I am only used to C and C++ which requires variables type to be declared as well as the type of the function will return. With Javascipt using Var and let is very odd because javascript is very loose in what variables type are. In addition strings, list and have a lot of built in functions. For example list already has a push and pop functions as well as being able to take any variable type unlike an array in C.

From a software engineering perspective I think javascript is useful as it has a lot of functions already built where as C does not have anything premade, requiring the user to build all the easy function by themselves. Learning ES6 was more confusing as their in-line function was not intuitive to me but using JSON objects was much more easy than C or C++. Given their dynamic size, it is much easier to work with objects than C and C++.

Being an athletic software engineer is important as being fit help help combat our sedentary lifestyle. Being athletic will also help us become more active , helping us focus during our work instead of being sleepy all the time and drinking caffeine to combat our lack of focus.

Practicing WODs are very important, such as being an athlete require constant practice to maintain their skills, so too much programming practice to keep their edge. It may be stressful at first just like anything new but once you build your skill, maintaining it will be enjoyable and easier.
